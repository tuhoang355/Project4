# About Me


Hello, my name is Tu Hoang and I am a Senior BSA-Biology Student at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Vietnam and move to the United States when I was 3 years old. I have lived in Houston ever since and could not asked for a better city to live in than the Bayou City. I am a first generation college student and just counting down the days until I graduate.

When it comes to education, I graduated from Benjamin O. Davis Sr. High School in Houston in 2016. Four years later, I am close to closing a chapter of my life at the University of Texas at Austin. I always had a passion for the sciences and mathematics. For this reason, I pursued a degree in Biology. After I graduate, I plan to go back to school in order to get a master and then hopefully a PhD in the sciences so I could spread the knowledges I gained throughout my educational journey to others. 

As for working experience and skills, I consider myself above average when it comes to the technologies or anything having to deal with computer. I am currently an Assistant Coordinator for the Teaching Assistant Program and as well as an Assistant System Administrator at my Local Parish in Houston.
